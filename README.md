# AdventOfCode2020
My solutions for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com)! (In python!)

Code will most likely be extremely difficult to follow (even for me!). I have not done things in a readable way or gone with the 'best practice'. Most of this code was written prioritizing speed. The code is kept in the state that it was at when the solution was found.

Only Advent of Code 2020 has been done 'competitively'. The rest have been done well past when the problems were released.

I am also using the 2020 event (and prior events) to get better at using python. I'm a Java programmer so python seems pretty slick...
